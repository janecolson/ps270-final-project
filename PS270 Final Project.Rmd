## Project Thoughts

I am interested in looking at data comparing reception of ads made in support of a political candidate vs ads that candidate makes against his or her opponent. I am curious as to what type of ad leaves a better impression on voters: ads speaking positively of the candidate or ads speaking negatively of the opposing candidate. I hope to see this through election data and results.
